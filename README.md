# audio_recorder_mc

A new flutter plugin project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter
[plug-in package](https://flutter.dev/developing-packages/),
a specialized package that includes platform-specific implementation code for
Android and/or iOS.

For help getting started with Flutter, view our 
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials, 
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Setup

### iOS

Then update your `Info.plist` with wanted permissions usage descriptions:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>

  <!-- ðŸš¨ Keep only the permissions used in your app ðŸš¨ -->

  <key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
  <string>Need microphone access for recording</string>

  <!-- â€¦ -->

</dict>
</plist>
```

### Android

Add all wanted permissions to your app `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
  package="com.myawesomeapp">

  <!-- ðŸš¨ Keep only the permissions used in your app ðŸš¨ -->

  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />

  <!-- â€¦ -->

</manifest>
```
